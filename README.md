My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)

From the [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about):
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

### 2019
The very first AoC event I took part in (yay!), with solutions in python.

The list of puzzles is available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
